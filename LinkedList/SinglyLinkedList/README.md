# Singly Linked List in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a **Singly Linked List** data structure. The program includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

## Operations
- **Insert at the beginning**: Adds a node at the start of the list.
- **Insert at the end**: Adds a node at the end of the list.
- **Delete from the beginning**: Removes the node at the start of the list.
- **Delete from the end**: Removes the node at the end of the list.
- **Traverse**: Prints all the elements of the list.
- **Search**: Checks if an element exists in the list.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program:

```bash
g++ SinglyLinkedList.cpp -o linkedlist
./linkedlist
